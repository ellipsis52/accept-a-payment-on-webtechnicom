Clone the WebTechnicom repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/WebTechnicom/WebTechnicom.git
Switch to the master branch:

Set up your payment gateway integration. This could involve integrating with a service like Stripe, PayPal, or any other payment processor. Follow the documentation provided by the payment gateway service for integration steps.

Implement the necessary frontend and backend code to handle payment processing. This could involve creating payment forms, handling payment callbacks, and updating the database with payment information.

Test the payment functionality thoroughly to ensure that payments are processed correctly and securely.

Once everything is set up and tested on the master branch, you can also repeat the same steps on the main branch if needed.
